1- Create an array rem_bt[] to keep track of remaining
   burst time of processes. This array is initially a 
   copy of bt[] (burst times array)
2- Create another array wt[] to store waiting times
   of processes. Initialize this array as 0.
3- Initialize time : t = 0
4- Keep traversing the all processes while all processes
   are not done. Do following for i'th process if it is
   not done yet.
    a- If rem_bt[i] > quantum
       (i)  t = t + quantum
       (ii) bt_rem[i] -= quantum;
    c- Else // Last cycle for this process
       (i)  t = t + bt_rem[i];
       (ii) wt[i] = t - bt[i]
       (ii) bt_rem[i] = 0; // This process is over
